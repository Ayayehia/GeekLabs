-Instructions for Users:

Toggle Sidebar on Hover:

Implement functionality to show the sidebar when hovering over the word "Alert" and hide it when the mouse leaves.
Ensure that clicking on the word "Alert" toggles the sidebar visibility: if it's visible, clicking should hide it, and vice versa.
Responsive Design:

Ensure responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices .
Use media queries or Tailwind's responsive utility classes to adjust layout and styling as needed for smaller screens.
Confirm that the design maintains usability and aesthetics across different screen sizes.

NOTE: IN MOBILE,TABLET I MADE THE RESPONSIVE RESPONSIVE AS HOW I SEE,AS THE DESIGN GIVEN WAS ONLY FOR DESKTOP.
